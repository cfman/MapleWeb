## Communication with server

Set the environment variable `VITE_WEBSOCKET_URL` in `.env` to the WebSocket url.

Implementation is still in progress. When the environment variable is not set, it will still work in a local mode for UI development.

### Protocol Converter

As this game is running on a browser, it needs to communicate with the server using WebSocket. While most of the server emulator use TCP sockets, a protocol converter is required for this client to connect to a server.

[websocat](https://github.com/vi/websocat) can be used to convert the TCP socket to a WebSocket connection.

The command to run websocat is as follows, refer to websocat's documentation for more details:
```bash
websocat --binary ws-l:127.0.0.1:8089 tcp:127.0.0.1:8484
```
